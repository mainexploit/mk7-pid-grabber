# MK7 PID Grabber
This is a Principal ID grabber CTRPluginFramework designed for Mario Kart 7 on the Nintendo 3DS.

It's purpose is to allow people to report cheaters in their in-game lobbies on platforms like [Pretendo](https://pretendo.network/).

> [!TIP]
> The Principal ID is the identifier of any user on the Nintendo 3DS. It's basically the friend code of the system but packed into a different series of numbers. It helps users to be unique and to differentiate them.

# How to use the plugin
Download the latest `mk7-pid-grabber.3gx` file.

Create a folder on your system's SD card: `SD:\luma\plugins\<Title ID>\`.

Use the the following `Title ID` depending on your version:
- **JPN**: `0004000000030600`
- **EUR**: `0004000000030700`
- **USA**: `0004000000030800`
- **KOR**: `0004000000030A00`

> [!NOTE]
> There are more versions. If yours isn't included, find it through [FBI](https://github.com/Steveice10/FBI) under `Titles` or search for it [here](https://3dsdb.com/).

Once that's done, place the `mk7-pid-grabber.3gx` file into the same folder.

While you're in the HOME-menu, open the `Rosalina Menu`. The key combination to enter it is `L + DPad Down + Select`. Navigate to the `Plugin Loader`, press `A` to change it to `Enabled` and finally go to `Save Settings`. Close the menu and launch your game. A blue flash should appear, which indicates that the plugin successfully loaded. If that doesn't occur, something went wrong and you should repeat the steps.

The button activator for the menu is `Select`.
